# Analyzing Subway Usage Patterns in Relation to Pandemic Outbreaks

## Introduction

The number of subway passengers decreased a lot due to COVID-19. However, other transportation passengers didn't diminish compared to the subway. We wondered why this phenomenon happened only in the subway. The project finds out what external factors have caused the number of subway passengers to change.

## Conclusion

1. Stations near universities showed a large decrease in usage due to online lectures in 2020.
2. Stations near the place where people originally crowded showed a large reduction rate. This happens because of social distancing and the fear of COVID-19.
3. The number of COVID-19 patients in the city did not significantly affect the number of subway passengers. It was not a crucial factor for subway riders.
4. The number of subway passengers decreased more than other transportation riders like buses and cars.
5. The number of passengers at subway stations around Jung-gu, where commercial districts are concentrated, decreased the most among all areas.
6. When the number of companies in each distinct increases, the rate of subway users also decreases more.
