## Visualization

Red Dot   - stations where passengers decreased more than 30%. \
Green Dot - stations where passengers decreased more than 20% to 30%. \
Blue Dot  - stations where passengers decreased less than 20%.

## Conclusion

1. Stations near universities showed a large decrease in usage due to online lectures in 2020.
2. Stations near the place where people originally crowded showed a large reduction rate. This happens because of social distancing and the fear of COVID-19.
3. The number of COVID-19 patients in the city did not significantly affect the number of subway passengers. It was not a crucial factor for subway riders.
4. The number of subway passengers decreased more than other transportation riders like buses and cars.
5. The number of passengers at subway stations around Jung-gu, where commercial districts are concentrated, decreased the most among all areas.
6. When the number of companies in each distinct increases, the rate of subway users also decreases more.
